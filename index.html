        <p>I did this course in addition to working with the Hanban HSK 4 Standard Course books. The coursera course helped me a lot to contextualize the grammar points and vocabulary and the exam preparation section felt like a good wrap up. I really like this course because the teachers explained vocabulary, give examples and grammar points clearly. Moreover, some tips to use when we take the HSK exams are also given. Now I feel ready to attend the HSK 4 exam. </p>
